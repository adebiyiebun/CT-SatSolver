# Python-SatSolver
### This project aims to understand how satisfiability solvers operate, and then create various types of SatSolvers.
### The methods of solving satisfiability problems are:
- DPLL Sat Solvers
- Simple Sat Solvers -> that iterate over every possible solution to find a correct one
- Branching Sat Solvers
